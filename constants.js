    title: 'Why Logic Should Be Taught in Middle School',
    excerpt: 'Critical thinking is not innate; it is a learned skill. Discover why starting early gives students a massive advantage.',
    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">In an age of information overload, the ability to discern truth from falsehood is more critical than ever. Yet, formal logic—the very framework of valid reasoning—is rarely taught in schools before the university level.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">At Nexus Academy, we believe middle school is the perfect time to introduce these concepts. Students at this age are beginning to question authority and the world around them. Giving them the tools to structure these questions constructively builds confidence and intellectual independence.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">The Benefits of Early Logic Education</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Improved Math Skills:</strong> Logic is the foundation of mathematical proof.</li>
        <li><strong>Better Writing:</strong> Structured thinking leads to structured essays.</li>
        <li><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Understanding fallacies helps de-escalate emotional arguments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By integrating logic into our core curriculum, we aren't just teaching students what to think, but how to think.</p>

    excerpt: 'AI is not here to replace teachers, but to augment them. How we are using tools like ChatGPT to enhance learning.',
    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">Artificial Intelligence is transforming every industry, and education is no exception. While some schools are banning AI tools, we are embracing them as essential instruments for the future.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Our approach is "AI Literacy." We teach students not just how to use prompts, but how the underlying models work, their limitations, and the ethical considerations of using them.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Practical Applications</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">In our coding classes, AI acts as a pair programmer, helping students debug code in real-time. In English, we use it to generate counter-arguments for debate practice, allowing students to sharpen their rebuttal skills against a tireless opponent.</p>
      <p>The future belongs to those who can collaborate with machines, not those who compete against them.</p>

    title: 'Top 5 Public Speaking Tips for Introverts',
    excerpt: 'Debate isn\'t just for the loud. Learn how quiet confidence can often be the most persuasive tool in the room.',
    content: `
      <p class="mb-4">Public speaking is often cited as a top fear, especially for introverted students. However, introverts often make the best debaters because they are naturally inclined to listen and analyze before they speak.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Here are our top tips for introverted speakers:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Preparation is Key:</strong> Anxiety often comes from the unknown. Knowing your material inside out reduces fear.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on the Message:</strong> Shift your attention from "how do I look?" to "what value am I giving the audience?"</li>
        <li><strong>Use Silence:</strong> A well-placed pause is more powerful than a shout.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice in Low-Stakes Environments:</strong> Start with small groups before moving to the stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Yourself:</strong> Authenticity resonates more than forced enthusiasm.</li>
